## üöÄ About Me

- Tech junkie by day, machine learning explorer by night. 
- I live for those ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments when the code finally clicks, and the model starts to do something cool. 

Always pushing the limits with AI, diving into data, and experimenting with new ways to make tech smarter. If it‚Äôs cutting-edge or just plain geeky, you‚Äôll find me there, figuring¬†it¬†out.
